## Hi there 👋

I am a new and aspiring CS student who is interested in the following fields:
🔐Cybersecurity, 
Networking

I truly believe these 2 fields are the the next best thing in aiding the safe and secure advancement of society and I hope to be able to contribute to society by mastering the skills of the respective fields I have just mentioned.

My hobbies are watching videos on cars and computers, as well as drumming!

Although I am new to programming as a whole and I am still learning the ropes, and programming is still quite difficult to me for now, I stand firm on the statement "Everything is hard before it gets easy."

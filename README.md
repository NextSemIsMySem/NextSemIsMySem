### Hi, I'm Daryl 👋

I'm a Computer Science student based in Malaysia with a strong interest in
**networking, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity**.

I enjoy working with systems that are built on **clear rules, protocols, and guarantees** —
things like TCP/IP, Linux, cloud networking, IAM, and security architectures.

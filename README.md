### Hi, I'm Daryl 👋

I'm a Computer Science student based in Malaysia with a strong interest in
**networking, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity**.

I enjoy working with systems that are built on **clear rules, protocols, and guarantees** —
things like TCP/IP, Linux, cloud networking, IAM, and security architectures.

### Current Focus 🔭

- Cloud infrastructure fundamentals (AWS-first)
- Networking & distributed systems concepts
- Linux systems and automation
- Security principles (defensive / blue-team oriented)
